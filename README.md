# PROJECT NAME: George's Notes App.

#PROJECT OWNER: George Njuki.

This is a notes taker application whereby you are able to add, delete and update the current notes.

It has been done as a project in part to the completion of my studies at Moringa school bootcamp.

The app is a single webpage that has been built using React.js and used pure css without any libraries.

It uses a JSON server to perform the CRUD operations .

I also has links to be able to take you to the notes page, the about page which includes the descriptions of the app, and also the links to my portfiolio and a random jokes generator app.
