# PROJECT NAME: George's Notes App.

GEORGE'S NOTES APP:

Project Author - George Njuki.

This project has been done as a project in part to the completion of my studies at Moringa school bootcamp.

The app is a single webpage that has been built using React.js and used pure css without any libraries.

It uses a JSON server to perform the CRUD operations .

It is a single page Notes taking app whereby you are able to add, delete and update the current notes.

The app uses React for structure and logic, CSS for styling and react router dom for the links. Design tools were not used in making this app.

How does it work, you ask?

Simple.

First, make sure you have npm installed.

Fork the repository and clone it to your choice folder. cd to that folder and run npm install to get the dependencies, run npm start and the app should run on a new tab. The app should now be working on your computer.

You just load it up on your browser and click the button to generate jokes randomly on the container. By cicking the button, a new joke is generated and the background-color of the container changes simultaneously with each new joke generated. That was actually the functionality that made me enjoy building this project.

I also has links to be able to take you to the notes page, the about page which includes the descriptions of the app, and also the links to my portfiolio and a random jokes generator app
